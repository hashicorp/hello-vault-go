# Quick Start

This is a quick example of how to retrieve your first secret from HashiCorp
[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), using HashiCorp's official
[Go client library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/vault/api).

## How To Use

Run the script `./run.sh` to set up a Vault dev server and run the example code.

You just wrote and read your first Vault secret!

## Next Steps

For a more realistic example of a runnable web app connecting to Vault using the
AppRole authentication method, check out the [sample app](../sample-app).
