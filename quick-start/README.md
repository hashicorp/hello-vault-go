# Quick Start

This is a quick example of how to retrieve your first secret from HashiCorp [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), using HashiCorp's official [Go client library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/vault/api).

## How To Use

1. Start the Vault dev server with `./run.sh`.
2. Run the sample code with `go run main.go`.

You just wrote and read your first Vault secret!

## Next Steps

For a more realistic example of a runnable web app connecting to Vault using the AppRole authentication method, check out the code in `../sample-app`.
